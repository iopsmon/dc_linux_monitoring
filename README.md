Linux Monitoring

This apps provides basic Linux Server Monitoring

Its design to check on a small number of CRITICAL servers, so you can use this with the free version of Splunk and it wont cost anything. You can also use it in a production enviroment, but keep a check on the volume of data and you will need to adjust the polling collection of metric data.

For this app, I have set the polling for every 5 minutes and based it on averages, this is best and most optimised way of getting some metric data in quickly, collected and viewing that data. Do you really need every second, from 1000's of servers...some do, but then we would have to think about the architecture, data volumes, etc....For now this app will get you started very quickly.

The Metrics I'm collecting are as follows, and based on average values only, this will enable you to determine the servers health very quickly, you can later change the metrics and polling times, but this is to get you started quickly.

- CPU – It is crucial to monitor CPU, as it can reach a high utilization.
- Load – This specifies whether the CPU is being used, how much is being executed, and how long   it has been running.
- Disk Capacity and IO – Disk capacity is especially important when it comes to file servers, data bases, Splunk servers, it can directly affect system OS and corrupt the operating system, or cause extreme IO slowness.
- Network – It's extremely important to monitor network performance as input and output of data packets. With network performance, you can measure the utilization of the card and see whats taking up lots o bandwidth
- Memory – Memory is used by many applications and is a key componenet for the proper function of providing services
- Swap Memory – This is virtual memory created by the system and allocated to disk to be used when necessary. Its high utilization can indicate that the amount of memory for the server is     insufficient.

Dashboard Features:

- cpu.system
- load.longterm
- memory.used
- memory.free
- df.free
- disk.io
- interface.packets.rx
- interface.packets.tx
- processmon.cpu.percent

Application Features:

- Uses metrics indexes - optimsed for metric data
- Uses the Analytics Workspace (Only available with Splunk 7.1 +) - SO Upgrade!

Data Config:
- Metric Data 
- data kept for 14 days
- index=linux_metric
- index size = 500MB

Script for Data:-

The app uses the TA-linux-metrics app, https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4856/ this uses a number of shell scripts, yes good old shell scripts....this collects the metric data and sends them to the metrics index linux_metric. You dont need collectd or any thirdparty tool, just deploy the TA-linux-metrics app to the target servers running the UF.

Requirements:
- Splunk 7.1 + (Metrics Workspace) 
- TA-linux-metrics

Install:

This app should be installed only on a Search Head, or All in one Splunk instance, the indexes.conf file needs to be deployed to the indexing layer or all in one server and the TA-linux-metrics needs to be deployed to the target Linux servers.

The git download already contains the TA-linux-metric add-on, or you get get it from Splunkbase

This app was only tested on Splunk on Linux

Download the zip and extract the file, copy the DC_ping_check folder to the Splunk Server
sudo cp -R DC_linux_monitoring /opt/splunk/etc/apps
sudo chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk/etc/apps
sudo -u splunk /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart

copy the TA-linux-metrics to the UF (Configure the polling and use the Deployment server for multiple server deployment)

Config:

The polling can be adjusted in the inputs.conf in the TA-linux-metrics, the data will be sent to index=linux_metric, this can be changed if required.

You will need to run chmod +x for the shell scripts to run /bin

Use:
Login to Splunk and go DC_linux_monitoring app and select dashboards, select the host and you should see the you should see data, this is providing you have installed the TA-linux-metrics onto the target linux servers.
